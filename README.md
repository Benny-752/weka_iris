# Iris 5 Classification 

This README provides information about the Iris 5 classification project, including the dataset used, the classification process, and a screenshot of the results obtained using the Weka software.

## Dataset
The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in machine learning and consists of 150 instances, each belonging to one of three classes: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, and Iris-virginica. Each instance has four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. In the Iris 5 classification project, we have expanded this dataset by adding a fifth feature, which is not a standard part of the original dataset.

## Classification Process
The classification process for Iris 5 involved the following steps:

1. **Data Preparation**: The dataset was loaded into the Weka software, and the fifth feature was added to each instance.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Any missing values or outliers were handled appropriately. In this specific project, we did not encounter any missing values or outliers due to the careful selection of the dataset.

3. **Feature Selection**: Feature selection techniques were applied to determine which features are most relevant for classification. The additional fifth feature was also considered in this process.

4. **Model Selection**: Various classification algorithms were experimented with, including decision trees, support vector machines, k-nearest neighbors, and more. The algorithms were evaluated based on their performance metrics.

5. **Model Training and Evaluation**: The selected classification model was trained on a subset of the data and evaluated using cross-validation techniques to assess its accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and other relevant metrics.

6. **Model Testing**: Once the model's performance was satisfactory, it was tested on a separate testing dataset to assess its real-world performance.

7. **Results Analysis**: The results of the classification were analyzed to determine how well the model performed in classifying the instances into the five classes.

## Conclusion
The Iris 5 classification project aimed to expand the classic Iris dataset by adding a fifth feature and classifying instances into five distinct classes. The project involved data preparation, preprocessing, feature selection, model selection, training, evaluation, and testing. The screenshot provided showcases the results of the classification using the Weka software.
